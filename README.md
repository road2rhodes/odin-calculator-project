# Calculator Project

This is the final project for...well, The Odin Project. I have learned so much in a short span of time. I am excited to take the tools gleaned from this, and other free and accessible learning platforms, and make a bit of magic.

What did I learn during this process?

- I became well acquainted with object methods
- I employed the this keyword, with both success and...well, not success.
- I refined my algorithm skills, trying to condense procedures when I can. For example, relying on length of a button's value to distinguish between number inputs and operator inputs in the same function.
- I experimented with prototypes, though I did not end up using them in this project.
- Of course, this required DOM manipulation. It still amazes how you can bring an otherwise static page to life.
