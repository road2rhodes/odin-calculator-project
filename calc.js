/*

* Calculator must add, subtract, multiply, divide
* Operations will be an operand, an operator, and then another operand.
*** Each item must be stored in separate variable (num1, opr, num2)

*** For design, calculator should have buttons for functions, equal, and clear.

* Create function that routes input. It will input first number and then check for value of operator variable to plug in 2nd number.
